* **Air quality impacts of switchgrass production (2018).** To my knowledge, the first study to quantify how farmer decisions such as where to grow crops and how to fertilize them impact human health through changes in air pollution.
[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953417303471 "Switchgrass paper"),              [Data](http://sumil.me/sg/map.html "Switchgrass data"),               [Media](https://www.altmetric.com/details/29593966/news)

* **Air quality impacts of US corn production (2019).** Life cycle corn production in the United States is associated with 4,300 deaths each year from changes in air quality alone.
 [Paper](https://depts.washington.edu/airqual/Marshall_105.pdf "Corn paper"),               [Media](https://www.altmetric.com/details/58270873/news "Corn media")

* **Racial inequity and air pollution (2019).** Non-Hispanic white Americans, on average, induce more pollution exposure from their consumption than they are, on average, exposed to. The opposite is true for Hispanic and black Americans.

* **Air quality impacts of every human-caused US emission source (2020)**. This study breaks down the 100,000 deaths each year from human-caused air pollution in the US, attributing them to every single emission source. The deaths are not just from fossil fuels, not just from tailpipes and smokestacks, not just from regulated pollutants.

* **Climate and air quality impacts from diversifying cropping systems (2020)**. Results from a long-term field experiment show that even adding one more small grain crop, like oats, to the dominant corn-soy rotation in the US Midwest can halve the life-cycle climate damages, air quality impacts, and fossil fuel use---all whilst maintaining farmer profits.

* **Climate impacts of the global food system (2020)**. Changes in the food system are necessary to meet our climate goals---*even if* fossil fuel combustion is rapidly halted.
 [Paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6517/705.abstract "1.5 paper"),               [Media](https://www.altmetric.com/details/93774409/news "1.5 media")

* **Air quality and the United States food system (2021)**. Attributing air quality-related deaths from agriculture to sources, food products, and diets, reveals that 80% of the ~16,000 food-related air quality deaths are from producing meat, dairy, and eggs. Even switching from an average diet to a flexitarian diet will reduce the deaths by 68%.

* **Air quality impacts of the global food system (2021)**. Around a quarter of outdoor air quality-related deaths worldwide are attributable to the global food system. Emissions are from across the supply chain, and include the majority of anthropogenic primary fine particulate matter emissions.
 [Paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac065f "AQ global food system"),               [Media](https://www.altmetric.com/details/114725387/twitter "AQ global food system media")

* **Global InMAP (2022)**. Development and evaluation of a global, open source, high-resolution, low-resource air quality model.
 [Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268714 "Global InMAP"),               [Data](https://zenodo.org/record/6189451#.Yo6w2ZPMKw0 "Global InMAP data")

* **Air quality and electricity generation in Southeast Asia (2022).** Southeast Asia expects to double electricity generation by 2040, increasing the share of coal-powered generation in the process, and thereby worsening air quality. Achieving the ASEAN High Renewable Energy Target is associated with 16,000 fewer deaths each year, relative to business-as-usual, by 2040.

* **Air quality and electricity generation in India (2022)**. Poorer, coal-dependent states in eastern India are disproportionately burdened by air pollution health impacts from electricity generation. Sulfur emission controls reduce the burden by 50% throughout India, and lessen state-level inequalities. Carbon taxes and nationally integrated electricity markets reduce deaths by only ~10%, mostly in South India.

* **Sustainability science at the meso-scale (2023)**. An emerging paradigm in sustainability science connects large-scale economic drivers of change (e.g., international trade, population dynamics) with small-scale environmental effects (e.g., crop yields, biodiversity indicators). But human decisions and the environment typically interact at the "meso-scale" (e.g., national or sub-national policies, agro-environmental management), which is often left out of the paradigm.

* **GTAP-InVEST (2023)**. The integration of a computable general equilibrium model (GTAP) with a suite of ecosystem service models (InVEST) to model how the economy and the environment interact.

* **Nitrogen management for people and planet (2023)**. Current nitrogen use in US Midwestern corn is net bad for society, leading to $21.3 billion annual losses. Better nitrogen management, through limiting reactive nitrogen emissions, lowering nitrogen input, and land retirement for the most unproductive and damaging corn, can turn these losses (almost) into gains.
