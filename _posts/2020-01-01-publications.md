* **Air quality impacts of switchgrass production (2018).** To my knowledge, the first study to quantify how farmer decisions such as where to grow crops and how to fertilize them impact human health through changes in air pollution.
[Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0961953417303471 "Switchgrass paper"),              [Data](http://sumil.me/sg/map.html "Switchgrass data"),               [Media](https://www.altmetric.com/details/29593966/news)

* **Air quality impacts of United States corn production (2019).** Life cycle corn production in the United States is associated with 4,300 deaths each year from changes in air quality alone.
 [Paper](https://depts.washington.edu/airqual/Marshall_105.pdf "Corn paper"),               [Media](https://www.altmetric.com/details/58270873/news "Corn media")

* **Racial inequity and air pollution (2019).** Non-Hispanic white Americans, on average, induce more pollution exposure from their consumption than they are, on average, exposed to. The opposite is true for Hispanic and black Americans.

* **Air quality impacts of every human-caused US emission source (2020)**. This study breaks down the 100,000 deaths each year from human-caused air pollution in the US, attributing them to every single emission source. The deaths are not just from fossil fuels, not just from tailpipes and smokestacks, not just from regulated pollutants.
 [Paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00424 "Interventions paper"),               [Media](https://acs.altmetric.com/details/85853433/news "Interventions media")

* **Climate and air quality impacts from diversifying cropping systems (2020)**. Results from a long-term field experiment show that even adding one more small grain crop, like oats, to the dominant corn-soy rotation in the US Midwest can halve the life-cycle climate damages, air quality impacts, and fossil fuel use---all whilst maintaining farmer profits.
 [Paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b06929 "Rotations paper"),               [Media](https://acs.altmetric.com/details/88055188 "Rotations media")

* **Climate impacts of the global food system (2020)**. Changes in the food system are necessary to meet our climate goals---*even if* fossil fuel combustion is rapidly halted.
 [Paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6517/705.abstract "1.5 paper"),               [Media](https://www.altmetric.com/details/93774409/news "1.5 media")

* **Global InMAP (2021)**. Development and evaluation of a global, open source, high-resolution, low-resource air quality model. *In Submission.*
 [Preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.14330375.v1 "Global InMAP")

* **Air quality and the United States food system (2021)**. Attributing air quality-related deaths from agriculture to sources, food products, and diets, reveals that 80% of the ~16,000 food-related air quality deaths are from producing meat, dairy, and eggs. Even switching from an average diet to a flexitarian diet will reduce the deaths by 68%.
