* **Air quality impacts of switchgrass production (2018).** To my knowledge, the first study to quantify how farmer decisions such as where to grow crops and how to fertilize them impacts human health through changes in air pollution.

* **Air quality impacts of United States corn production (2019).** Life cycle corn production in the United States is associated with 4,300 deaths each year from changes in air quality alone.

* **Racial inequity and air pollution (2019).** Non-Hispanic white Americans, on average, induce more pollution exposure from their consumption than they themselves are exposed to.

* **Air quality impacts of every human-caused US emissions source (2020)**. This study breaks down the 100,000 deaths each year from human-caused air pollution in the US, attributing them to every single emissions source. The deaths are not just from fossil fuels, not just from tailpipes and smokestacks, not just from regulated pollutants.

* **Climate and air quality impacts from diversifying cropping systems (2020)**. Results from a long-term field experiment show that even adding one more small grain crop, like oats, to the dominant corn-soy rotation in the US Midwest can halve the life-cycle climate damages, the air quality impacts, and the fossil fuel use---all whilst maintaining farmer profits.
