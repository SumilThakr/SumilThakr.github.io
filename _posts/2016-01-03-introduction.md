Hi, my name is Sumil and I am a PhD student at the University of Minnesota! My research interests so far are pretty broad: anything to do with agriculture, energy and the environment. Right now, though, my focus is on air quality.

As you can see, I haven't done very much with this website right now, but hope to update it in the near term. If you want to contact me, telepathy is my preferred medium, but failing that I have an e-mail address: it's "s" followed by "thakrar" at umn dot edu.
