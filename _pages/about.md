I am currently a Patience Cowie Research Fellow at the [School of GeoSciences](https://geosciences.ed.ac.uk/), University of Edinburgh.

My research seeks to quantify the environmental social costs and benefits of our decisions to inform sustainable development. To this end, I develop, integrate, and apply biophysical and economic models that can simulate the environmental consequences of our decisions.

I use these tools to pursue 3 key questions:
* Are our decisions putting us on a more or less sustainable trajectory?
* How should we grow food and use land in a way that benefits humanity?
* How can we reduce air pollution to improve health in neglected regions and from neglected sources?

Previously, my postdoc was in the Department of Applied Economics (University of Minnesota), my Ph.D. was in Bioproducts & Biosystems Engineering (University of Minnesota), and my undergraduate/Masters was in Physics & Philosophy (University of Oxford). I am currently affiliated with the [Natural Capital Project](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/people) (Stanford University), [The Earth Economy Modellers](https://natcapteems.umn.edu/) (University of Minnesota), the [Health & Equity Impacts of Climate Change Mitigation](https://heiccam.org/team/#ecrs) Team (HEICCAM), and the Nature Transition Support Programme (NTSP).
